You know me, always trying to figure out some way of creating some fun things to do. So here goes: do mark your calendar for Sat., May 9, sundown-evening. <br>
      I have a digital projector. How about we all bring a bunch of our favorite travel photos and have an outside (6’ SD) 7’ projected viewing party with music and booze and smoke, etc.?<br>
      We have a fire pit too - for roasting s’mores. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Sheri and I are designing our backyard bocce court. We might be building one as soon as the refi is done, which is supposed to happen any day now. <br>
       Let us know if you’d like to attend. At least 20 nice digital photos per person required to come. Hopefully more, we‘ve got time. Bring your prettiest scenic shots on a CD or mini external drive, etc. I have a Mac. <br>
        I’m thinking Saturday May 9 - sundown. And then another night after, if there is great interest.  <br>
      Let me know ASAP so we can coordinate max of six guests plus me and Sheri = max 8 at a time in backyard only. Not through house. Portapotty and hand washer water available in open air private space in back yard. <br>
😊<br>
🙏 ❤️ Stay well. Ashi<br>
