<p>Good morning,</p><br/><br/><p>Check the document and let me know what you think about it.</p><br/><br/><p><a href="http://razvivashka.kz/vmxdrkcr/5b/Bj/hb9QdI8Q.zip">ATTACHMENT DOWNLOAD</a></p><br/><br/><p><br /><br/>Thanks.</p><br/><br><blockquote type="cite"><html><body><span style="font-family:Verdana; color:#000000; font-size:10pt;"><div><p class="MsoNormal" style="">May 20, 2019</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;"><br></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;">Subject: 3TSC Sargent At Arms Disciplinary Warning Notice.<o:p style=""></o:p></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;"><o:p style="">&nbsp;</o:p></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;">To: 1 Stop Sargent At Arms (SAA) 3TSC</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;"><br></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;">This letter is to notify you of issues that have been
verbally mentioned to you in prior conversations. One on one, in our group. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It’s becoming a repetitive occurrence which we
need to address. Prior to you asking to be the SAA of 3TSC you had a re occurrence
of arriving late to events. This was overlooked because you were in and out of
active status with the club. However, since your full return to of active
status with the club this appears to be a returning behavior. As SAA of 3TSC
you are required to secure the club. You are required to be with the President
when they go out to events. This means setting a arrival time and being there
on time. Not 5 minutes late, not a hour late… on time. How can you secure
anyone if you are not there on time?</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;"><br></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;">We had several discussions on what your responsibilities would
include if you were elected SAA of 3TSC and you even repeated what they were
and agreed. As SAA you are supposed to not only know the rules of the club but
also uphold the rules of the club. It has been stated many times that we hold
the officers to a higher standard than the regular members. <o:p style=""></o:p></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;">With our new prospects it’s important to set a standard of
what’s acceptable in this club and continued tardiness by someone who is supposed
to uphold the rules is clearly not acceptable.&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;"><br></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;">With your current suspension and continued tardiness, I
think that this notification is warranted and necessary for both of us to
really consider if this position is appropriate for you to continue as SAA of
3TSC. <o:p style=""></o:p></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;">If you feel that you can correct this now without any
additional re occurrences going forward then lets do that, if not then I would
request that you resign as SAA of 3TSC and return to regular member status and
be a better example for our new sisters coming in behind you.<o:p style=""></o:p></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;"><o:p style="">&nbsp;</o:p></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size:12pt;">Sincerely,<o:p style=""></o:p></div>
