> When we spoke yesterday you advised me that you had paid the sum of =C2=
=A37,094.80 on 12th October and that this included the insurance premiums=
.. I calculate that the total due for rent and insurance is =C2=A37,893.89=
 which is =C2=A3799.09 more than the figure you have paid. The insurance =
premiums inc VAT total =C2=A3993.88 per the attached invoices. The rent t=
otal is =C2=A36,900 (2x =C2=A32,875 +VAT) so I am wondering what the diff=
erence (between the rent due and the amount paid) of =C2=A3194.80 represe=
nts. It's can't be service charge as the amount due for this for both uni=
ts is =C2=A3250.92 inc VAT. Either way, if you paid =C2=A37,094.80 then a=
 further =C2=A3799.09 is still due to cover the insurance premiums in ful=

 this tenant away and then you don't take the unit on. Your old unit, Uni=

> Thanks for your email. We have been marketing Unit C3 since about May t=
his year without much interest but have now recently agreed terms to re-l=
et it. The lease is due to commence from the day the current tenant's lea=
se expires (i.e. 30th September) so there would be no void period. I cann=
ot therefore give you first refusal. Currently we have no vacant units on=
 the estate. Unit D3 is however vacant as the tenant has moved out but th=
eir lease does not expire until August 2016 so they are still responsible=
 for the unit until then. We have recently tried to simultaneously take a=
 surrender of their lease and re-let the unit to a new tenant but have ha=
d to abandon this transaction because the existing tenant, Stevens Beltin=
g, refused to complete the remedial works set out in the schedule of dila=
pidations drawn up for the unit including repairing damaged cladding. It =
may be that they would be willing to sublet the unit to you if you need e=
xtra space. Alternatively there are a number of other units with lease ex=
piries in 2016 including in late February, Unit C1, which backs onto Unit=
 C5. At this stage I cannot predict if the tenant of Unit C1 or indeed an=
y other tenants with lease expiries in 2016 will wish to remain (or if we=
 will wish to renew their leases) but there is of course the possibility =
of Unit C1 or other units of the estate becoming vacant over the next 12 =
months. If the proposed transaction for Unit C3 does not proceed I will a=
dvise you immediately.=0D

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;=
Perpetua&quot;,serif">When we spoke yesterday you advised me that you had=
 paid the sum of =A37,094.80 on 12<sup>th</sup> October and that this inc=
luded the insurance premiums. I calculate that the total=0D
 due for rent and insurance is =A37,893.89 which is =A3799.09 more than t=
he figure you have paid. The insurance premiums inc VAT total =A3993.88 p=
er the attached invoices. The rent total is =A36,900 (2x =A32,875 &#43;VA=
T) so I am wondering what the difference (between the=0D
 rent due and the amount paid) of =A3194.80 represents. It&#8217;s can&#8=
217;t be service charge as the amount due for this for both units is =A32=
50.92 inc VAT. Either way, if you paid =A37,094.80 then a further =A3799.=
09 is still due to cover the insurance premiums in full (provided=0D
 the service charge amounts were also paid separately). Perhaps, by copy =
of this email, Richard could confirm the amount received of =A37,094.80.<=

 therefore give you first refusal. Currently we have no vacant units on t=

or the unit until then. We have recently=0D

existing tenant, Stevens Belting, refused to complete the remedial works =
set out in the schedule of dilapidations=0D
 drawn up for the unit including repairing damaged cladding. It may be th=

 2016 including in late February, Unit=0D
 C1, which backs onto Unit C5. At this stage I cannot predict if the tena=

of course the possibility of Unit C1 or=0D
